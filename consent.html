                <p><span class="lead">Invitation to Take Part</span> We would like to invite you to take part in a research project. This document provides some information to help you decide whether to do so. Please take time to read this information carefully and consider whether you wish to take part. If there is anything that you do not understand, or if you would like more information, please ask us. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="purpose">
                <p><span class="lead">What is the purpose of the study?</span> We are interested in how medical trainees and professionals gather information when making diagnostic decisions. We intend to investigate this using a computer-based task where you will be provided with sample patient cases that have been adapted from real past patients. You will be asked to use the information provided to make your best judgement on how you would diagnose the patient’s condition by choosing options using the computer mouse. Our anonymised data recordings are only intended for research purposes and will be not used for other purposes (e.g. for evaluating medical performance).</p>
            </section>
            <section id="why">
                <p><span class="lead">Why have I been invited?</span> You have been invited to take part in this research because you are aged 18-70, fluent in English, and are working as a medical professional or are a medical student. </p>
            </section>
            <section id="withdraw">
                <p><span class="lead">Do I have to take part?</span> No. It is up to you to decide if you want to take part in this study. We will describe the study and go through this information sheet with you to answer any questions you may have. If you agree to take part, we will ask you to sign a consent form. However, you would still be free to withdraw from the study up until the data is stored and anonymised, without needing to give a reason.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="procedure">
                <p><span class="lead">What will happen to me if I decide to take part?</span> This study should take no more than 60 minutes of your time. Before the experiment, we will ask you to fill in questionnaires about your medical decision making style and personality. During the experiment, you will be presented with a series of ‘patient’ scenarios, whereby you will be presented with an initial presenting complaint. You will then have the opportunity to request information and test data about the ‘patient’. Your aim will be to diagnose the ‘patient’, reporting which potential diagnoses you consider and your confidence in your decision making. You will report how likely and how severe the diagnoses you are considering are, updating your beliefs as you receive more information. These ‘patient’ scenarios are based on real past patient cases. You will be debriefed and told the true diagnoses of the ‘patient’ cases at the end of the session. You will also have the chance, during the debrief, to explain your thought process. We request that you approach each ‘patient’ case as you would in your everyday medical practice. </p>

            <section id="risks">
                <p><span class="lead">Are there any possible disadvantages or risks from taking part?</span> The study involves no risks beyond those incurred in everyday work.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="benefits">
                <p><span class="lead">What are the possible benefits of taking part?</span> There are no direct benefits to you but you will be making a contribution to science and our understanding of medical decision making.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="privacy">
                <p><span class="lead">Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential?</span> Any information collected about you during this study would be kept strictly confidential. We will keep personal information (your name, contact and payment details) as part of our records of your informed consent to participate, and in order to make payments for your participation in this study. Responsible members of the University of Oxford may be given access to data for monitoring and/or audit of the study to ensure we are complying with guidelines. Our finance office is required to have information relating to payments and contact details for 7 years in case of financial audit. <br> <br> Research data (including task performance/questionnaire answers) will be anonymised with a code so that the results could not be linked back to you. All the data are kept on firewall and password- protected computers that are only accessible by the research team. The results of the research may be published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals and may become part of oral presentations at relevant scientific conferences. A copy of my thesis/ dissertation will be deposited both in print and online in the Oxford University Research Archive where it will be publicly available to facilitate its use in future research. Results will be anonymised and stored on the Open Science Framework for other researchers to collaborate and ensure the reproducibility of research conducted. Good scientific research encourages the sharing of information. As such, your anonymised results may be shared with other researchers to be used in other research studies.

            <section id="leave">
                <p><span class="lead">What will happen if I don't want to carry on with the study?</span> You are free to leave the study at any time if you decide that you no longer wish to take part. If you are a student, there would be no academic penalty if you decide you do not want to take part in this study, or if you decide to withdraw at any point. Further, if you are a student attending courses taught by the researcher(s) conducting this study, you are under no obligation whatsoever to participate, and are free to withdraw your consent to participate at any point, without penalty. You are able to withdraw up until the point of data analysis, at which time all data will be anonymised. <br> <br> The University of Oxford, as Sponsor, has appropriate insurance in place in the unlikely event that you suffer any harm as a direct consequence of your participation in this study.
